# Tumor Dynamics Modeling Using PINNs

- Implementing the Game theory ODE that captures the interaction between resistant and susceptible tumor cell populations.
- Incorporating biological insights, such as fitness costs, treatment impacts, and population dynamics.
- Using Runge-Kutta numerical method to establish reference solutions.
- Solving the system with PINNs and assessing their accuracy comparing with linearization.
